easyGestures N provides a highly customizable pie menu for browsing the Web from where the mouse pointer is located.

It is a fork of version 4.3.2 of the easyGestures extension created by Ons Besbes, who maintained it until Firefox 4.

Current development efforts focus on migrating easyGestures N to a WebExtension so that it remains compatible with future versions of Firefox. Help is very much welcome, especially for updating and maintaining both the visual appearance and the formerly supported locales.
