tips.openAltMenu = By default, right clicking while the pie menu is open will successively display up to three alternative menus. You can change the default mouse button in [preferences/activation]. You can also use an 'Alt' key to switch to the following alternative menu.
tips.menusCustomization = You can customize in [preferences/menus] all the different menus with many built-in actions. Usage statistics might help you place these actions at an optimal location on the pie menu.
tips.openExtraMenu = To display the extra menu, just move the mouse pointer over this action's icon.
tips.clickOnLink = By default, opening the pie menu on top of a link will open the link and close the pie menu for as long as no activity is detected for a brief amount of time.

tips.tooltips = You can disable the tooltips in [preferences/behavior].
tips.searchWebAction = You can perform a search with one of your search engines with the 'Search web' action. If a piece of text is selected, the selection will be copied into the search box. Just press 'Enter' to perform the search.

tips.loadURLActions = You can open your favorite sites by customizing the 'Load URL' actions in [preferences/customizations/customizations.loadURLActions] and then adding these actions to the pie menu.
tips.advancedLoadURLActions = When configuring the 'Load URL' actions in [preferences/customizations/customizations.loadURLActions] keep in mind that you can use the tokens '%s' and '%u' in an URL.\n\n'%s' will be replaced with the current selection, which is useful to e.g. do a dictionary lookup with the URL https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%s.\n\n'%u' will be replaced with the current URL, which is useful to e.g. translate the current page using the URL https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=%u.
tips.runScriptActions = You can execute a piece of Javascript code by customizing the 'Run script' actions in [preferences/customizations/customizations.runScriptActions] and then adding these actions to the pie menu.
tips.contextualMenus = By default, you can display the contextual menu by pressing an 'Alt' key while opening the pie menu on top of a link, an image or a text box, or while opening the pie menu when there is some content selected. You can change the default key and turn on the automatic activation of the contextual menu in [preferences/activation].
tips.preventOpen = By default, you can prevent the pie menu from opening by holding a 'Ctrl' key; no default key is set on a Mac. You can change the default key in [preferences/activation].
tips.moveMenu = You can move around the pie menu by holding a 'Shift' key while moving the mouse.
tips.smallIcons = You can switch to small icons in [preferences/behavior].
tips.largeMenu = By default, menus are composed of 8 actions. You can switch to 10 actions menus in [preferences/behavior].
tips.autoscrolling = If you use the middle mouse button to open the pie menu, autoscrolling will no longer be available. By enabling autoscrolling in [preferences/behavior], it will become available after a configurable delay of inactivity. You can also enable autoscrolling when other mouse buttons and/or keys are used to open the pie menu.
tips.zoomOnImage = A zoom action over an image performs that action only on that image.
tips.openLinkAction = By default, the 'Open link' action opens the link under the pie menu in a new tab. You can change this default behavior in [preferences/customizations/customizations.otherActions].
tips.dailyReadingsAction = The 'Daily readings' action opens all bookmarks contained in a folder of your choice (and in its sub-folders) in new tabs. You can select that folder in [preferences/customizations/customizations.otherActions].
